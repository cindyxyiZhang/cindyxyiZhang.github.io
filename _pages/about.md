<!--
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professors [Brian Caffo](https://sites.google.com/view/bcaffo/home) and [Zheyu Wang](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/zheyu-wang/2777733). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto in 2023, under the supervision of Professors [Dehan Kong](https://sites.google.com/site/kongdehanstat/), [Linbo Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/linbowangpku/home), and [Stanislav Volgushev](https://utstat.toronto.edu/stanislav/). 
<!-- Here is my [CV](https://cindyxyizhang.github.io/files/cv.pdf). -->
<!-- Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from University of California, Berkeley, and I spent my undergraduate years at the University of Toronto where I received my Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematical Application in Economics and Finance, and Statistics.  
Here is my [CV](https://cindyxyizhang.github.io/files/cv.pdf). -->


Research interests
------
My research navigates the challenges of large-scale and complex data. In particular,  
* With a focus on achieving efficient estimation and robust statistical inference, I develop methodologies tailored for analyzing data characterized by high-dimensionality, massive volume, functional dependency, temporal dependency, incompleteness, and latent variable. 
* Building on this, my work extends to transforming complex datasets into practical insights. Some applications include 
causal discovries from observational studies, disease progression tracking, identification of brain activations. 
<!-- in response to specific stimuli or tasks. -->
* Recently, I've also become interested in exploring to what extent deep learning methods, compared to traditional pipelines, can simplify the preprocessing of medical imaging data and effectively extract informative features for disease detection and monitoring. 


<!-- * I'm interested in developing statistical methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality. 
* Statistical and computational challenges of complex data: high-dimensional data (large $$p$$, small $$n$$), longitudinal data, partially labeled data
* and the intersection of high dimensional statistics and causal inference.
* Causal inference with instrumental variables
* High-dimensional statistics
* Applications in neuroimaging and genetics -->
